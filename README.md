## FoundationDB SQL Layer ActiveRecord Adapter

The [FoundationDB SQL Layer](https://github.com/FoundationDB/sql-layer) is a
full SQL implementation build upon the [FoundationDB](https://foundationdb.com)â€™s
storage substrate. It provides the same high performance, multi-node scalability,
fault-tolerance, and true multi-key ACID transactions.

This project provides connection adapter integration for ActiveRecord.

Support for v4.0, the current stable release, is underway but not yet complete.
